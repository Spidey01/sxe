[ ] Fix sources of brain damage / not enough time to do it well.
[ ] Maybe make OpenGL stuff throw a checked 'GraphicsException' on failures like e.g. bad shader compile?
[ ] Replace Action with a standard Java type like Callabe?
[ ] Should SettingsFile be trapping IOException and blanking the contents? I think not.
[ ] Some way of addressing the installation root, resource paths, etc.
[ ] ResourceHandle#asTexture should inspect URI for file extension (.png, .jpg, etc) and act accordingly. Also should have an overload that allows specifying the format.
[ ] Maybe make GpuProgram able to init from a Program ID #?
