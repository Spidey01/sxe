[ ] Setup gradlewrapper.
[ ] Update documentation, NOTES, etc.
[ ] Fix sources of brain damage / not enough time to do it well.
[X] There should be a way for `gradle tags` to make ALL tags.
[ ] A way to configure things like setting log level separately per tag, from .cfg file.
[ ] Maybe make OpenGL stuff throw a checked 'GraphicsException' on failures like e.g. bad shader compile?
[ ] Replace Action with a standard Java type like Callabe?
[X] Maybe rename ScriptEngine to ScriptManager? It'd be a more conventional name I think.
