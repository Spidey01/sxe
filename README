This is an experiment in making a game engine. It's intended for real use but hacked in odd moments and occasionally odd purposes, so don't expect master to always be in a well engineered state.

SxE is intended to be simple, modular, and able to deal with platforms. PC and Android are officially supported.

To build the system, generally, you want something like this:

	gradle -q build

Exact procedures for building an SDK or a project is not well defined yet. The installApp, distZip, and distTarget targets should generally work where applicable, e.g. for demo applications but not necessarily as a top level target.

Code is structured into subproject modules for the core system, platform dependencies, and other modules such as scripting and demo applications.

Most external dependencies are supplied through a repository. Those that cannot be, will usually be found somewhere in vendor/. Assume that you will require network connectivity the first time you build SxE.
