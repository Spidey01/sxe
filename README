This is an experiment in making a game engine. It's intended for real use but hacked in odd moments and occasionally odd purposes, so don't expect master to always be in a well engineered state.

SxE is intended to be simple, modular, and able to deal with platforms. PC and Android are officially supported.

To build the system you must set the sxeTarget property. Refer to settings.gradle for values. Generally, you want something like this:

	gradle -q -PsxeTarget=pc build

The installApp, distZip, and distTarget targets should generally work where applicable, e.g. for demo applications.


Code is structured into subproject modules for the core system and platform dependencies. Demo apps do like wise.

Most external dependencies are supplied through a repository. Those that cannot be, will usually be found somewhere in deps/. Refer to deps/README for details.
