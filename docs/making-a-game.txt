Implementing a game ontop of the engine is fairly simple and designed to get you focused on your game quickly, rather than on mucking with engine details.

Every game consists of two things:

	A.) An instance of 'Game'; and
	B.) Initialization code.

Just subclass Game. This is where you will do just about everything of an interesting and game specific nature :-).

For initialization, the details depend on the platform. Code is provided to make this easy when possible. In essence, it entails initializing an instance of GameEngine and your Game, calling the engines start() function, event looping, and eventually calling stop().
